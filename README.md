# Welcome to Cassie's Plants

This project was created and named after my 9mo old puppy who is an English lab. To get started go ahead and fork the `main` branch and run `npm install` to get all the dependecies needed before running `npm run dev` to load the project on your local machine. 

You'll have a fully functional ecomm website where you can see a list of plants to adding them to your cart and removing and deleting items from your cart. You can't checkout as this project isn't taking online payments and doesn't actually have an inventory of plants to sell. 


Below is a preview of the auth portals you'll have the chance to explore by creating an account or by signing in.

Once signed in you'll be redirected to the plants page where you can add items to your cart. You'll notice we are saving the state for the `pot_color` you have selected. As well as randomizing the image thumbnails based on the pot_color. Once a plant that you have selected as well as the pot color. The item will be added to your cart with the price and the total price at checkout. Deleting and item will also update the cart's price.

Feel free to explore the different designs on a desktop vs on mobile as there are a few different implementations. Hint: Check out the navbar on mobile.
